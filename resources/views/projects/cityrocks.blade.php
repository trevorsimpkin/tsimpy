        <p class="lead">I have been a City Rocks mentor for the past two years. "The City Rocks program empowers students to develop self-confidence, creativity, and the ability to succeed through the sport of rock climbing."</p>
        <p>As an avid rock climber and someone who believes in the power of mentorship, being a City Rocks mentor was a natural fit for me. It has been a true joy to mentor a local high school student. We meet at least twice a month, but usually every week to climb, do school work, and/or just hang out. During this time I have seen my mentee grow into a strong climber and a strong young man and he is now going off to college. I will be starting a new mentoring relationship in the fall!</p>
